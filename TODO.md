# Possible improvements
- [x] Client-side cryptographic verification of Diffie-Hellman exchange (!!).
- [ ] Client-side authorized keys database.
- [ ] 100% crate documentation.
- [ ] Provide client and server examples.
- [x] Improve rekeying threshold calculation.
- [ ] Test rekeying implementation.
- [ ] Test project against multiple async runtimes.
- [ ] Take care of `KexInit::first_kex_packet_follows` being true.
- [ ] Implement compression & decompression algorithms (now broken).
- [ ] Implement legacy key exchange methods (`diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`).
- [ ] Implement latest ciphers (`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`, `aes256-gcm@openssh.com`, `aes128-gcm@openssh.com`).
- [ ] Add a service-handling facility.
- [ ] Make use of `zeroize` to ensure forward secrecy.
- [ ] Implement a service for authentication.
- [ ] Getting rid of dynamic dispatch altogether ?
- [ ] Get rid of `ring` for Diffie-Hellman ?
- [ ] 100% test coverage ?
