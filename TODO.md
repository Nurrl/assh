# Possible improvements
- [x] Client-side cryptographic verification of Diffie-Hellman exchange (!!).
- [ ] Client-side authorized hosts key database.
- [x] 100% crate documentation.
- [ ] Provide client and server examples.
- [x] Improve rekeying threshold calculation.
- [x] Test rekeying implementation.
- [x] ~~Share the rng per-session to avoid re-spawning one each time.~~: Uses the thread-local rng provided by rand already.
- [ ] Disable insecure algorithms by default behind an `insecure` feature.
- [ ] Test project against multiple async runtimes.
- [ ] Take care of `KexInit::first_kex_packet_follows` being true.
- [ ] Implement compression & decompression algorithms (now broken).
- [ ] Implement legacy key exchange methods (`diffie-hellman-group14-sha256`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, `diffie-hellman-group1-sha1`).
- [ ] Implement latest ciphers (`chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com`, `aes256-gcm@openssh.com`, `aes128-gcm@openssh.com`).
- [x] Add a service-handling facility (_layers_).
- [ ] Make use of `zeroize` to ensure forward secrecy.
- [ ] Implement a service for authentication.
- [ ] Getting rid of dynamic dispatch altogether ?
- [x] Get rid of `ring` for Diffie-Hellman ?
- [ ] 100% test coverage ?
